**Usage**:
`python brainfuck.py helloworld.bf`
or for the live interpreter,
`python brainfuck.py --live`

This is a brainfuck interpreter I wrote.
This version inparticular has a few extra features
that are probably pretty useless, but they're there
for some extra fun.

It includes an example file called helloworld.bf
As it's name describes, is a simple Hello World! program.
