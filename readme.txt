Usage:
python brainfuck.py [file name]
or for the live interpreter,
python brainfuck.py --live

You can also include a -h at the end to
hide the cell output when the program
finishes execution


This is a brainfuck interpreter I wrote.
This version inparticular has a few extra features
that are probably pretty useless, but they're there
for some extra fun.


It includes an example file called helloworld.bf
As it's name describes, is a simple Hello World! program.
