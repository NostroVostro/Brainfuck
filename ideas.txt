Using pipes and ampersands to put a cell into
memory, and being able to access that cell

	&++

	Using the pipe commands, we could toss a cell into 
	memory, and access it with &, allowing us to set
	the current cell to whatever cell is current cell is 
	set to the & token.

	Would set & to be the 3rd cell from our current cell

	|&<|
	Would set & to be the cell before the cell currently set to &
